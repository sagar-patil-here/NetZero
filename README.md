## NetZero — Real‑time Carbon Emissions Tracking for Industry

### Overview
NetZero is a practical tool for industrial companies to monitor and manage their carbon emissions in near real time. By giving operations teams continuous visibility, the product helps organizations stay within regulatory limits, reduce risk of penalties, and take corrective action before issues escalate.

### Why this project exists
In the traditional approach, companies rely on third‑party auditors to conduct annual (or periodic) reviews of their carbon emissions. By the time an audit reveals that limits were exceeded, the window to act has already passed and companies face penalties, reputational damage, and follow‑on legal processes.

NetZero addresses this gap by enabling ongoing measurement and insight so teams can act earlier—well before a formal audit—avoiding excess emissions and fines.

> This project is made for industries with carbon emissions. It is a useful tool for them to track emissions so they do not exceed their limits and get fined. Traditionally, a third‑party team performs a yearly audit. When companies find out about excess emissions, the time to take corrective action has already passed, and they must pay penalties and go through legal procedures. Our product helps them act earlier, before limits are exceeded.

### How NetZero helps
- **Continuous monitoring**: Track emissions frequently instead of waiting for annual audits.
- **Early warnings**: Detect trends that could lead to limit breaches and intervene proactively.
- **Operational visibility**: Share easy‑to‑understand dashboards across teams (operations, EHS, compliance).
- **Audit readiness**: Keep structured records and insights that complement third‑party audits.

### Key features (current and planned)
- **Real‑time/near real‑time dashboards** for critical emission metrics
- **Smooth preloader and transitions** for a responsive UI experience
- **Reusable UI components** for charts, sections, and calls‑to‑action
- Planned: **Data ingestion adapters** for meters/sensors/ERPs
- Planned: **Alerting & notifications** for thresholds and trends
- Planned: **Role‑based access control** and audit logs

### Project structure
- `BackEnd/` — Backend services (APIs, data ingestion, processing) [scaffold]
- `FrontEnd/` — React app (Vite + Tailwind) and UI components
  - `src/components/` — Feature sections, transitions, preloader, and UI widgets
  - `src/lib/` — Utilities

### Getting started (Frontend)
1. Install requirements
```bash
cd FrontEnd
npm install
```
2. Run the dev server
```bash
npm run dev
```
3. Build for production
```bash
npm run build
```

If you plan to integrate live data, connect the frontend to endpoints exposed by `BackEnd/` once available.

### Usage
- Use the dashboard to watch current emissions and historical trends.
- Configure thresholds to highlight approaching limits and trigger action.
- Share views with operations and compliance for coordinated response.

### Roadmap
- Data connectors (sensors, SCADA, ERP, CSV uploads)
- Alerts (email, chat integrations) and threshold policies
- Benchmarking, forecasting, and reduction tracking
- Access control, audit logs, and exportable reports
